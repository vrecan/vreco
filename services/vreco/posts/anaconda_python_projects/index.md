# Overview
I needed to start building out python data science projects dealing with complex dependencies like Pandas, Scikit-learn & Tensorflow. While trying to build these dependencies I have found that it can be pretty difficult just trying to use pip install with some of them. I had read that Anaconda & Mini-Conda can make things a lot easier.
